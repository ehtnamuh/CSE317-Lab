    "We can approximate the value of a function at a point by using the Taylor series expansion of the function. We have already seen an example of how to expand a function using the Taylor series expansion.  In this section, we will use the Taylor series expansion to approximate the value of a function at a point. \n",

    "But, the Taylor series expansion is an infinite series and we oviously cannot compute the value of an infinite series. So, we will use the first few terms of the Taylor series expansion to approximate the value of the function at a point. The number of terms we use in the Taylor series expansion is related to the order of the Taylor series expansion.  The order of the Taylor series expansion is one less than the number of terms in the Taylor series expansion.  For example, if we use the first three terms of the Taylor series expansion, the order of the Taylor series expansion is 2.  If we use the first four terms of the Taylor series expansion, the order of the Taylor series expansion is 3.  And so on.\n",
